On July 1st 1997, China *resumed the exercise of  sovereignty of Hong Kong* and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, SAR was established. The year of 2022 marks the 25th anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the establishment of the Special Administrative Region. In that duration, the city has *embarked on a remarkable journey*. The relationship with the motherland has grown much closer on multiple fileds, economic, political, culture, you name it. And there's exciting culture exchange on the way, the Hong Kong Palace Museum will be open to visitors on July 2nd, and I heard it is fully booked already.
